Hey don't modify stuff in here directly, this isn't ours to mess with!

... Unless you really gotta hack someone else's code which does happen from time to time Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Any external or third party libs should be cloned into this directory as their own subdirectory, and can be included as git submodules or just source or whatever. Don't modify these files manually, but do try to keep them updated. Or don't - idk actually now that I think about it ðŸ¤”

This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

and a contents of `src/main.c`:
```
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will find automatically dependent
libraries scanning project source files.
